# Troubleshooting Apache Spark [Video]
This is the code repository for [Troubleshooting Apache Spark [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/troubleshooting-apache-spark-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781789805253), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
	In this course, you will learn how Spark's computation model works and leverage the DataFrame API along with its optimizations. Joining is one of the most important features in any Big Data tool and you will implement joins and write code in an efficient way. Implementing efficient transformations is hard. Common problems can cause your processing to go on a very long time. You will learn how to leverage reusing objects, and reduce setup and startup overheads using shared variables. Also, you will master Spark streaming and solve problems that arise while using that API.
